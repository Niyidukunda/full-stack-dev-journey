# Web Development Learning Journal

* An interactive learning journal documenting my journey into full-stack web development.

Welcome to my technical learning journal â€” a personal record of my practical exploration into full-stack web development, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, React, and deployment strategies.

This repository captures my practical experience, challenges, and achievements as I explore concepts like front-end design, backend architecture, and modern web technologies.

## Mission

This repository serves as a resource for anyone looking to understand full-stack web development and its ecosystem. It aims to provide:

Step-by-step guides for setting up and using web development tools

Reflections on challenges and solutions encountered during the learning process

Practical examples and use cases for web development in real-world scenarios

## Tech Stack

HTML & CSS: For structuring and styling web pages

JavaScript: For dynamic and interactive web functionality

Node.js: For backend development and server-side scripting

React: For building modern, component-based user interfaces

Git & GitHub: For version control and collaboration

PostgreSQL: For relational database management

Web3 & DApps: For decentralized applications and blockchain integration

## Simon Game Project

This file documents how I created and deployed the Simon Game, an interactive memory game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Features

Interactive gameplay with increasing difficulty

Responsive design for mobile and desktop

Modular code structure for easy updates

Deployment

The Simon Game is hosted on GitHub Pages.

* Reflections

Building the Simon Game helped me understand DOM manipulation and event handling in JavaScript.

Debugging gameplay logic improved my problem-solving skills and attention to detail.

Deploying the project taught me the basics of hosting static sites and using GitHub Pages.

The Simon Game was inspired by concepts and projects from The Complete Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp by Dr. Angela Yu.

* Troubleshooting

If the game does not load correctly, ensure your browser supports modern JavaScript features and check for any missing assets in the repository.ts with the cluster accordingly.
